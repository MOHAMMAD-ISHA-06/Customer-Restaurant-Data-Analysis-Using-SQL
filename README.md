🍽️ Customer and Restaurant Ratings SQL Project
A complete SQL‑based analytical project exploring consumer behavior, restaurant cuisines, satisfaction levels, and rating trends using multiple SQL operations like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CTEs, Views, and Stored Procedures.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes consumer ratings across restaurants, identifies patterns based on demographics, determines cuisine preferences, and extracts actionable insights using SQL queries.
The analysis is done on a relational database consisting of:

consumers — consumer demographics
restaurants — restaurant details
ratings — ratings given by consumers
restaurant_cuisines — cuisine associations
🧰 Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL)
JOIN operations
Aggregations: COUNT, AVG
CTEs
Subqueries
Views
Stored Procedures
🔍 1. Students Who Are Also Smokers
SELECT consumer_id, age, occupation
FROM consumers
WHERE occupation = 'Student' AND smoker = 'Yes';
⭐ 2. Highly Satisfactory Ratings (Overall Rating = 2)
SELECT consumer_id, restaurant_id, overall_rating
FROM ratings
WHERE overall_rating = 2;
🏙️ 3. Consumers Who Rated Restaurants in 'San Luis Potosi'
SELECT DISTINCT c.consumer_id, c.age
FROM consumers c
JOIN ratings rt ON c.consumer_id = rt.consumer_id
JOIN restaurants r ON rt.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
WHERE r.city = 'San Luis Potosi';
🌮 4. Mexican Restaurants Rated by Consumer 'U1001'
SELECT r.name
FROM restaurants r
JOIN restaurant_cuisines rc ON r.restaurant_id = rc.restaurant_id
JOIN ratings rt ON r.restaurant_id = rt.restaurant_id
WHERE rc.cuisine = 'Mexican' AND rt.consumer_id = 'U1001';
🚫 5. Consumers Who Rated Restaurants but NOT Italian Cuisine
SELECT DISTINCT c.consumer_id, c.age, c.occupation
FROM consumers c
JOIN ratings rt ON c.consumer_id = rt.consumer_id
WHERE c.consumer_id NOT IN (
  SELECT rt1.consumer_id
  FROM ratings rt1
  JOIN restaurant_cuisines rc ON rc.restaurant_id = rt1.restaurant_id
  WHERE rc.cuisine = 'Italian'
);
🎓 6. Students Who Rated More Than 2 Restaurants
SELECT rt.consumer_id, COUNT(rt.restaurant_id) AS no_of_restaurants
FROM ratings rt
JOIN consumers c ON c.consumer_id = rt.consumer_id
WHERE c.occupation = 'Student'
GROUP BY rt.consumer_id
HAVING COUNT(rt.restaurant_id) > 2;
📌 7. CTE: Consumers in San Luis Potosí + Mexican Restaurants Rated Highly
WITH con_in_San AS (
    SELECT * FROM consumers WHERE city = 'San Luis Potosi'
)
SELECT DISTINCT con.consumer_id, con.age, r.name
FROM con_in_San con
JOIN ratings rt ON con.consumer_id = rt.consumer_id
JOIN restaurants r ON r.restaurant_id = rt.restaurant_id
JOIN restaurant_cuisines rc ON r.restaurant_id = rc.restaurant_id
WHERE rc.cuisine = 'Mexican' AND rt.overall_rating = 2;
📊 8. Average Age of Consumers by Occupation
SELECT c.occupation, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM consumers c
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT consumer_id FROM ratings
) AS rated_consumers
ON c.consumer_id = rated_consumers.consumer_id
GROUP BY c.occupation;
🏆 9. View of Highly Rated Mexican Restaurants (Avg Rating > 1.5)
CREATE VIEW HighlyRatedMexicanRestaurants AS
SELECT r.restaurant_id, r.name, r.city
FROM restaurants r
JOIN restaurant_cuisines rc ON r.restaurant_id = rc.restaurant_id
JOIN ratings rt ON r.restaurant_id = rt.restaurant_id
WHERE rc.cuisine = 'Mexican'
GROUP BY r.restaurant_id, r.name, r.city
HAVING AVG(rt.overall_rating) > 1.5;
🛠️ 10. Stored Procedure: Restaurant Ratings Above Threshold
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetRestaurantRatingsAboveThresholds (
    IN p_restaurant_id VARCHAR(20),
    IN p_min_overall_rating INT
)
BEGIN
    SELECT consumer_id, overall_rating, food_rating, service_rating
    FROM ratings
    WHERE restaurant_id = p_restaurant_id
      AND overall_rating >= p_min_overall_rating;
END $$
